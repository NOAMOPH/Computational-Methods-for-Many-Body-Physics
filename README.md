# Computational Many-body Physics Course (Grad. Lavel)

## Overview
Welcome to the Computational Many-body Physics assignments repository for Professor Keselman's course at the Technion, Israel. This repository contains implementations and analyses of various computational techniques for classical and quantum many-body problems. The assignments are designed to familiarize students with these techniques and enable them to efficiently simulate and analyze physical systems.

## Course Description
Upon successful completion of this course, students will become acquainted with a variety of computational techniques for classical and quantum many-body problems relevant to present-day research. Students will be able to analyze a given problem, understand which method would result in the most efficient simulation and analysis, implement the appropriate numerical algorithm, and analyze the outcome of the numerical simulations interpreting the physical properties of the system under study.

## Assignments
1. **Exact Diagonalization (ED)**
2. **Tensor Networks and Time Evolution Block Decimation (TEBD)**
3. **Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)**
4. **Classical Monte-Carlo (MC)**
5. **Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC)**

## Final Project
In addition to the assignments, there is a final project focusing on the Hubbard-Holstein model.

## About the Code
The code in this repository is written by Noam Ophir, an MSc student in physics at the Technion. The implementations are primarily in Julia and provided in notebook files. Please note that the code might not be perfectly accurate, but it serves as a learning tool for exploring computational techniques in many-body physics.

## Usage
Each assignment and the final project is contained within its own directory. Within each directory, you will find the necessary code files and notebooks for running the simulations and analyses. Instructions for running the code and interpreting the results are provided within the respective notebooks.

## Disclaimer
Please be aware that while the code provided here is meant to facilitate learning and understanding of computational techniques in many-body physics, it may contain errors or limitations. It is recommended to consult with the course instructor or reference materials for verification and clarification.
