You can now easily access system sizes of up to $N = 100$ sites (performing e.g. 10 sweeps with bond dimensions of order 100), but to clearly observe a finite gap for $g > g_c$ it is still advisable to consider values of g close enough to $g = 1/2$.*"

For $g\\leq g_c$ calculate the exponent $\\alpha$, and for $g > g_c$ obtain the correlation length $\\xi$.
